Ansible Automation for Infrastructure Setup & Software Deployment

This Ansible playbook automates infrastructure provisioning and software installation across multiple managed servers.

Task 1 (L1): Set up a Control Server (CS) and Managed Servers (MS). Install JDK 8 on MS1, MS3, MS5, and JDK 17 on MS2, MS4.
Task 2 (L2): Install JDK 8 on MS1, JDK 17, Maven, Git, and Git Clone on CS, MS1, MS2, and MS3.
Task 3 (L3): Extend L2 by adding MySQL installation, configuration, and database dump on CS, MS1, MS2, and MS3.
Task 4 (L4): Install JDK 17, Maven, PostgreSQL, Git Clone, and build the application on MS1. Transfer the generated JAR file to MS2 and upload it to AWS S3.
This automated approach ensures efficient software deployment, configuration management, and scalability across the infrastructure.
